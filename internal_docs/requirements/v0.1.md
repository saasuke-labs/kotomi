# Kotomi v0.1

v1 focuses on the JSONs API to store and retrieve comments.

The endpoint to store comments will include a sanity check using Open APIs Chat GPT so messages that include:

- Ads, aggressive messages, etc will be red flagged.
- Messages that do not seem related to the post will be yellow flagged
    - in the future users will decide wether these messages are automatically published


## Requirements

- Publish a message to Kotomi for a given site / page.
  - Receive and log the message
  - Moderate the message (for now all users will get this)
  - Make the message "public"
- Retrieve comments for a given site / page (public messages only)

For starters there is no way for users to register and create their sites. 
We will hardcode the site id for now.

## Pending before going to prod

- User registration
- Site management
- Basic comments management
