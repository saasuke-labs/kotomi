# Kotomi v0.1

v1 focuses on the JSONs API to store and retrieve comments.

The endpoint to store comments will include a sanity check using Open APIs Chat GPT so messages that include:

- Ads, aggressive messages, etc will be red flagged.
- Messages that do not seem related to the post will be yellow flagged
  - in the future users will decide wether these messages are automatically published

## Requirements

### Management

- Basic Landing UI.
- User can register via UI as "Owner"
- Owner can register Sites
- Owner can see, publish, unpublish or delete Comments under the Pages on their Sites

### Contribution

- Public users can Publish a message to Kotomi for a given site / page.
  - Receive and log the message
  - Make the message "public" automatically (moderation will come later)
- Retrieve comments for a given site / page (public messages only)

## Pending before going to prod

- Automatic moderation
